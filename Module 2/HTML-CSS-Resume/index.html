    <h2 class="problemSolverIntro">Problem solving experience</h2>
        <p class="problemSolverSpark">At Spark I had many interactions across all demographics and devices.<br>
            <li>Android problems which sometimes needed ADB.</li>
            <li>iOS & Apple devices. Sometimes transferring data with broken screens.</li>
            <li>Device debugging before sending the phone away.</li>

        <p class="problemSolverWestpac">At Westpac, I used my background in encoding to create a barcode.<br>
        The reason this barcode was neccesary was because when the EFTPOS <br>machine ran, it took literally 
        minutes to let it update - which we could <br>only do at the first customer. I developed a $0.00 barcode
        for everyone <br>at Westpac in Wellington to use so the first cutomer wouldn't have to<br> experience this
        wait every morning.</p>
